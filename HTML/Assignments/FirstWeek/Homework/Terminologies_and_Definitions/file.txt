===================== HTML ========================================================================================================

  (1) What do HTML and CSS stand for? 
        HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
        - This is where you build the structure of the anatomy of your website, more like the bones.
    
    CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
        - In this case is the flesh that covers the bones, or more specific the attributes, colors, the looks, etc. 

  (2) Would you rather use HTML or CSS, for putting paragraphs of text on a webpage?
        The answer is HTML, as we mentioned in the previous question, it is the anatomy/structure of the site. 
        Which means the main role it's to put things in the right place and not on how it looks. 
        We can add paragraphs by using the tag <p>

  (3) Would you rather use HTML or CSS, to change the font and background color of a button?
        The answer is CSS, as soon you realize you're trying to change the APPEARANCE based on fonts, colors, etc. 
        Then, CSS is the best way to go.

  (4) What is a HTML tag?
        Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
            - Opening tags: tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. 
              They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>. 

                For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: <p>.

            - Closing tags: tell the browser where an element ends. 
              They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. 
    
                For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: </p>.

  (5) What are the three parts of an HTML element? 
        - Opening tag
        - Content
        - Closing tag

  (6) What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
        The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. 
        The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

  (7) What is the HTML element?
        This is what’s known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other element in the document
        will be a descendant of it.

  (8) What is the purpose of the head element?
        The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required
        for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element
        that displays content on the webpage.

  (9) What is the purpose of the body element?
        The <body> element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users
        such as the text, images, lists, links, and so on.

 (10) How do you create a paragraph in HTML?
        <p></p>

 (11) How do you create a heading in HTML?
        <head></head>

 (12) How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between them?
        There are six different heading tags in HTML <h1> to <h6>. The heading defined within <h1> is the most important 
        i.e. larger font-size and font-weight whereas <h6> is the least important i.e. least font-size. 

 (13) What element should you use to make text bold and important?
        - <b></b>
        - <strong></strong>
        - class="bold_text"></>

 (14) What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?
        - <i></i>
        - <em></em>

 (15) What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?
        - The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.
        - HTML parent elements can have many children. 
        - We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves and other developers.

 (16) What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?
        - Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings.

 (17) How do you create HTML comments?
        - <!-- comment --> by pressing: CTRL+/

 (18) What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list?
        - Unordered lists are created using the <ul> element.

 (19) What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list?
        - Ordered lists are created using the <ol> element. 

 (20) What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists?
        - Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element <li>. 

 (21) What element is used to create a link?
        - Anchor Elements - To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. 
        An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag

 (22) What is an attribute?
        - An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag.
        An attribute is made up of two parts, a name, and a value. In our case, we need to add a href (hyperlink reference)
        attribute to the opening anchor tag. 

 (23) What attribute tells links where to go?
        - The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.

 (24) What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?
        - Absolute links: Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. 
        A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path.

        - Relative links: Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
        Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
        it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

 (25) Which element is used to display an image?
        - To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. 
        Unlike the other elements we have encountered so far, the <img> element is empty. 
        Which means it doesn’t have a closing tag.

 (26) What two attributes do images always need to have?
        - src: works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. 
        It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths

        - Alt attribute: Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.
        The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
        It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

 (27) How do you access a parent directory in a file path?
        - href="./folder/destination

 (28) What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?
        - JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG images
