        One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist ONE. 
        It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch
        but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge due to his overwhelming strength. 
        ONE wrote the original webcomic version in early 2009.
